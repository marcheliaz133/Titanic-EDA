      The RMS Titanic sank on April 15, 1912, after striking an iceberg, resulting in the deaths of 1,502 out of 2,224 passengers and crew. This tragedy shocked the world and exposed major flaws in maritime safety regulations, particularly the insufficient number of lifeboats onboard. 
         Beyond the technical shortcomings, the disaster also raised critical questions about who survived and why. What factors influenced survival rates? Were age, gender, or social status significant factors in determining the chances of survival?
