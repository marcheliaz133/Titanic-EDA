# Titanic-EDA
The sinking of the RMS Titanic remains one of the most well-known maritime disasters in history. This project seeks to uncover patterns behind who survived and who didnâ€™t by analyzing passenger data. This project focuses on factors such as age, gender, and social status to understand how these characteristics may have influenced survival rate. Through this analysis, we aim to turn historical tragedy into data-driven insight.
